/**
 * Variant 4.4 
 * Find a closest integer with the same weight. Define the weight of
 * a nonnegative integer x to be the number of bits that are set of 1 in its
 * binary representation. 
 * 
 * For example, since 92 is in base-2 equals (1011100)_2,
 * the weight of 92 is 4. 
 * 
 * Write a program which takes as input a nonnegative
 * integer x and returns a number y which is not equal to x, but has the same
 * weight as x and their difference, |y-x|, is as small as possible. 
 * 
 * Assume x is not 0, or all 1s. Solve in O(1) time and space.
